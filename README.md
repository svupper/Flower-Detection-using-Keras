# Flower-Detection-using-Pytorch-Ligthning

This repository contains the code for the Flower Detection using Pytorch Lightning. The dataset used for this project is [Flower Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition) dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains 4242 images of flowers. The dataset is divided into 5 categories: Daisy, Dandelion, Rose, Sunflower, and Tulip. The dataset is divided into 70% training and 30% validation.

## Requirements

The requirements for the project are:

- Pytorch
- Pytorch Lightning
- Torchvision
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Usage

To train the model, run the following command:

```bash
python train.py
```

To run inference on the model, run the following command:

```bash
python inference.py
```

## Results

The model achieved an accuracy of 85% on the validation set.
